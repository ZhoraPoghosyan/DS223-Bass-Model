# Bass Model Analysis  

This project analyzes how global consumer spending on smart home technologies has evolved from 2015 to 2025 and uses the **Bass Diffusion Model** to understand and forecast the adoption behavior of such technologies over time.

The **Bass model** is a widely used tool in marketing and innovation research. It helps us estimate how many people will adopt a new product based on two types of adopters:  
- **Innovators** who adopt early based on external influence (parameter **p**)  
- **Imitators** who adopt based on interactions with others (parameter **q**)  

By fitting the model to real consumer spending data, we can predict future trends and visualize the speed and saturation of adoption in the market.
